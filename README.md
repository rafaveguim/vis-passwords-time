An interactive display of the date references in a collection of 32 million passwords.

I extracted numeric sequences from the passwords of the RockYou password leak and matched them against common date formats.
The frequency of days, months, and years is shown in the visualization, as well as the most frequent passwords containing a date-like numeric sequence.

This visualization is featured in [this](http://vialab.science.uoit.ca/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/ver2012a.pdf) VizSec publication. You can learn more about this project in its own [page](http://vialab.science.uoit.ca/portfolio/visualizing-semantics-in-passwords) at vialab's website.
